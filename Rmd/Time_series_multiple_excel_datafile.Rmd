**Aim**: Create a figure panel for plotting continuous data (time series).\
Works for plotting Time series data from several data file (excel table).

### Important note:

For the notebook to work you need to have your root folder structured as follow:

```{r echo=FALSE}
dir_tree(path = "..", type = 'directory', recurse = TRUE)
```

### Preparation steps.

1.  Loading of the required packages.

The packages are loaded using the function "library".

*Note: To install packages, use the following function: "install.packages('name_of_package')"*

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(shiny)
library(fs)
```

2.  Setting up the 'Here' package.

The function "here()" is used to declare the location of the current script as the root for the project folder.\
*As a consequence, no absolute path will be required anymore and the Notebook can be used on any machine given that the folder structure is respected).*\
More info can be found at: [here](https://here.r-lib.org/articles/here.html)

```{r}
here::i_am("Time_series_plot_for_Ca2+.Rproj")
```

3.  Include session information.

It is good practice to include session information

```{r}
xfun::session_info()
```

### Step 1: Create an object that includes the path to the data files.

```{r}
data_path <- paste(here("data", "raw_data"), list.files(here("data", "raw_data")), sep = "/")
head(data_path)
```

### Step 2: Loading (reading) data & generate a 'nested' dataframe (dataframe of dataframes)

The data are loaded from the excel files using the function "readxl".\
The loaded data are included in an "R object" named 'df_input' using the character: '\<-'.\
In addition, the first lanes of the object are visualized using the function "head".\
*Note: df stands for dataframe (type of data loaded)*

```{r}
df_input <- map(data_path, readxl::read_excel)
head(df_input)
```

### Step 3: Naming the loaded dataframe according to the files names.

This could be changed by a button to specify the desired name

```{r}
names(df_input) <- str_replace(list.files(here("data", "raw_data")), pattern = ".xlsx", replacement = "")
head(df_input)
```

### Step4: Merge the dataframes.

A single dataframe with all data is generated.\
A new column named 'id' is created to keep the origin of the date (initial filename).

```{r}
df <- bind_rows(df_input, .id = 'id')
head(df)
```

### Step5: Reshaping data to tidy format

1.  Remove empty space in data frame and replace it by an underscore.\
    The function "str_replace" is used to replace a character string with another one.\
    Here the space ' ' is replaced by underscore '\_' with the arguments "pattern =" and "replacement =".

```{r}
names(df) <- str_replace(names(df), pattern = " ", replacement = "_")
head(df)
```

2.  Give the generic name "Time" to the column "Time (sec)".\
    The function"rename" is used to change the name of the column in the following way: "new_name=old_name". **This might be changed with a user input command to choose the desired name**

```{r}
df <- rename(df, Time='Time_(sec)')
head(df)
```

3.  Tidy the data.\
    All the value data for every sample are attributed to a single column.\
    The function pivot_longer is used with the following arguments:\
    -   'cols = -c(id, Time)' exclude (with the '-' character) the columns id and Time from being modified.\
    -   'names_to = "Sample"' Creates a column with a header 'Sample' containing character string.\
    -   'values_to = "Value"' Creates a column with a header 'Value' containing numerical values.

```{r}
df_tidy <- pivot_longer(df, 
                        cols = -c(id, Time),
                        names_to = "Sample",
                        values_to = "Value")
head(df_tidy)
```

### Step3: Generate plot using ggplot.

This uses the function ggplot function with the following arguments

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_tidy,
       aes(x=Time, 
           y=Value, 
           group=id)) + geom_line(aes(color=Sample)) + theme(legend.position = "none")

```
